CRCS Portal: "Streamlining Cooperative Societies Management - Hackathon Project"

This GitHub repository is a part of the hackathon where we were tasked with creating a comprehensive dashboard for the Central Registrar for Cooperative Societies (CRCS) portal. 

The project focuses on streamlining the registration process, managing amendments and appeals, and handling annual returns for multistate cooperative societies in India. 

Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, this project showcases our team's efforts to deliver an intuitive and efficient solution within the given timeframe. 

Contributions and feedback are welcome as we aim to enhance the functionality and user experience of the CRCS Portal."
